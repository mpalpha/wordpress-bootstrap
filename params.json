Using Eddie Machado's Bones for a starting point (https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones).\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n\r\nWe’ve built the WP-Bootstrap theme so that it could be used as-is or as a starting point for theme developers. It’s built on top of the brilliant Bones theme framework by Eddie Machado and based on v2.3.1 of Bootstrap.\r\n\r\nStar this project on Github to keep up with its progress.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nCUSTOM BOOTSTRAP GRID GENERATOR\r\n\r\nI've added a bootstrap css grid generator. It will generate a custom bootstrap grid stylesheet to override the static responsive stylesheet from bootsrtap. If no name is specified it will override the original bootstrap grid styles! default grid: 60+20*12=960 grid\r\n\r\nexample: &lt;link href=&quot;bootstrap-grid.php?name=namespace-&amp;col=12&amp;cw=60&amp;gw=20&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nResponsive\r\n\r\nWe stick as closely as possible to bootstrap so this thing is natually responsive.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nPage Templates\r\n\r\nWe’ve packaged four different page templates into this theme.\r\n\r\n- Homepage template (seen on the homepage of this site)\r\n- Standard page with right sidebar (this page)\r\n- Page with left sidebar\r\n- Full width page\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nTheme Options Panel\r\n\r\nWant to change some colors? Want the top nav to scroll with the content? Hide the search box in the top nav? Do it in the options panel.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nShortcodes\r\n\r\nWe’ve built in some shortcodes so you can easily add UI elements found in Twitter Bootstrap.\r\n\r\nSidebars\r\n\r\nWe’ve built in two different sidebars. One for the homepage and one for the other pages. Add widgets to them.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
